## Q + A

**Shouldn't this be a daemon, a proper OS X app, or something like that?**  
Yup. That's probably a good next step.

**Colo Colo?**  
A creature with some chicken-like attributes, and some potential to growl (although
apparently it cries more than growls). From [Wikipedia][]: "if Colo Colo is not killed,
it will murder its victim."
